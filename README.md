# Algorithms Visualized

These are a few visualizers I made for my diploma, turned out kinda nice so thought might as well dump 'em on GitHub.

All of them are written in vanilla JavaScript and uses canvas for drawing stuffs. Feel free to fork and play around.

### Algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Selection sort
- Linear search
- Binary search

`I might add some other algorithms in future, if I have enough time to write the visualizers.`
